Prompts: goal - generate better hypothesis
1. Define hypothesis: an educated guess that tries to explain an observed phemoneno (data -> theory/explanation). The key is explanatory power
2. CoT Prompting
3. Good hypothesis: inductive reasoning, comminiation, synthesis with existing knowledge (optional)
4. Generalizability: the current prompt in HypoGeniC is specific to each dataset
5. Try prompting method of AutoRules
6. Self critisism

Dataset
1. Make the system easier to adapt to new datasets in various format


Game plan:
Dataset: Retweet & President election

Experiments:
Model: Gemini
1. Benchmark: run HypoGeniC with the existing methods, with best-accuracy hypothesis
2. Summarize benchmark results:
    - Classification accuracy on test & OOD
3. Prompt changes
4. Evaluations
